        Robert Boyle produced hydrogen gas in 1671 while he was experimenting with iron and acids
        The element was named hydrogen by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier.
        It is found in the sun and most of the stars, and the planet Jupiter is composed mostly of hydrogen
        On Earth, hydrogen is found in the greatest quantities as water. 
        It is present as a gas in the atmosphere only in tiny amounts – less than 1 part per million by volume.`

        French astronomer Pierre Janssen was on-hand in India to watch, and to measure the sun's atmosphere, known as the chromosphere.

        On the Earth, most helium is a radioactive decay product of uranium and thorium. It is found under the Earth's crust with other natural gases. 
        Helium is used for medicine, scientific research, arc welding, refrigeration, gas for aircraft, coolant for nuclear reactors, cryogenic research
        and detecting gas leaks.
        NASA uses helium as an inert purge gas for hydrogen systems and a pressurizing agent for ground and flight fluid systems. 
        Helium has many unique properties: low boiling point, low density, low solubility, high thermal conductivity and inertness
        Helium was the first gas used for filling balloons and dirigibles.

    Canada had limited production of lithium from 2014 to 2019 and none in 2020. Several companies are currently working to develop lithium projects from traditional hard rock mining to unconventional sources such as oilfield brines and industrial wastewaters, in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. These projects range from early exploration to an advanced stage.
